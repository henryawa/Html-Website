    <p>My favorite books were written by a Nigerian novelist Chinua Achebe.</p>

    <p>
      Chinua Achebe was a Nigerian novelist, poet, and critic who is regarded as
      the dominant figure of modern African literature. His first novel and
      magnum opus, Things Fall Apart, occupies a pivotal place in African
      literature and remains the most widely studied, translated and read
      African novel.
